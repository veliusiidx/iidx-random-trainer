Instructions:
Start Bistrover in Admin mode (Make sure it's the latest DJH release)
Start the trainer once monitor check has finished and the game is fully loaded in Admin mode
Click back in game

Controls:

TAB-Insert random for P1. Type with top row numbers. Press enter when finished.

Q-Exits random lock/displays random for P1. Useful when you want to go back to normal game play.


BACKSLASH-Insert random for P2.

]-Exits random lock/displays random for P2.

Issues:
If you select R-Random while you have locked a random, it will only rotate across the random you've locked and not nonrandom/mirror.

Build instructions: Just copy and paste the code in Visual Studio or your favorite C++ compiler and that should be enough.

Also this code is a dumpster fire. If anyone wants to refactor or merge changes, feel free.
