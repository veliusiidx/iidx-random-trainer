Instructions:

-If you're using Bemanitools, rename launcher.exe to spice64.exe. Spicetool users should be perfectly fine.

-Start Bistrover in Admin mode (Make sure it's the latest DJH release)

-Make sure the game is set to FREE PLAY

-Start the trainer once monitor check has finished and the game is fully loaded in Admin mode

-Click back in game


Controls:

TAB-Insert random for P1. Type with top row numbers. Press enter when finished.

Q-Exits random lock/displays random for P1. Useful when you want to go back to normal game play.

BACKSLASH-Insert random for P2.

]-Exits random lock/displays random for P2.


Issues:
If you select R-Random while you have locked a random, it will only rotate across the random you've locked and not nonrandom/mirror.

Build instructions: Just copy and paste the code in Visual Studio or your favorite C++ compiler and that should be enough.

Also this code is a dumpster fire. If anyone wants to refactor or merge changes, feel free.
